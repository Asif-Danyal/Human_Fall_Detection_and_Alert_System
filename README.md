# Human_Fall_Detection_and_Alert_System
To address the unintentional human fall, we introduce a cutting-edge real-time human fall detection and alert system. The system works by analyzing frames captured by indoor surveillance cameras continuously. These frames are fed into a trained artificial intelligence YOLO model that focuses on detecting human falls within the footage. When frames are received, the AI model examines the scene to identify individuals and determine if a human fall has occurred using CV algorithms and the YOLO model. If no human fall is detected, the surveillance will proceed as usual. However, caregivers or authorities are promptly notified via email, including the relevant frame showing the fallen individual for immediate intervention and also siren is trigered.
